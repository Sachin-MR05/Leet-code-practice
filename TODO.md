# Fix GitHub Action Organizer - COMPLETED ✅

## Steps Completed:
1. [x] Update organize.py to handle "0048-rotate-image" format
2. [x] Fix problem name extraction from hyphenated format to title case
3. [x] Test the script locally - SUCCESS!
4. [x] Verify GitHub Action workflow

## Issue Fixed:
- Script now correctly handles folder format: "0048-rotate-image" → "Rotate Image" → maps to "numpy" category
- Script processes folders in "others/" directory first, then checks for new problems
- Added proper error handling and logging

## Current Status:
- ✅ "0048-rotate-image" successfully moved from others/ to numpy/
- ✅ Other folders remain in others/ (correct behavior)
- ✅ Script is ready for GitHub Action workflow

## Next Steps:
- Commit and push the updated organize.py
- The GitHub Action will automatically trigger on push and organize new problems
