# 🚀 Daily LeetCode Practice – ML/DL Focused

Welcome to my **Daily LeetCode Practice Repository**!  
Here I solve **LeetCode problems** every day, especially those related to **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **core Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** that strengthen my AI engineering skills.

#



## ⚡ Why ML/DL + LeetCode?

- 📊 **Matrix Manipulations** → Similar to **NumPy / Tensor operations**.  
- 🔗 **Graph Problems** → Core for **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**.  
- 🎲 **Probability & Combinatorics** → Strong foundation for **ML algorithms**.  
- 🔄 **Dynamic Programming** → Used in **sequence models (RNNs, Transformers)**.  

By solving DSA problems, I’m strengthening the **computational thinking** needed in **AI projects**.
